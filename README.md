# 🚀 Machine Learning Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Learning Repository** 👋  
This repository documents my structured learning journey in **Machine Learning**, starting from **Python fundamentals** to the implementation of various **Machine Learning algorithms**.

The main goal of this repository is to build a **strong conceptual foundation**, followed by **hands-on implementations** using real-code and examples.
